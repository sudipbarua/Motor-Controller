# Motor-Controller
## Description:
In this project a DC motor controller was developed that generates PWM signal from a given digital serial data as input. The complete design is divided into two major components. 
* Design of a PWM Generator (Digital part) using VHDL
* Implementation of motor-controller [TI DRV 8837](https://www.ti.com/product/DRV8837) using VHDL-AMS (Analog part)
The PWM Generator is divided into further three components.
* [PWM-Controller]( https://github.com/sudipbarua/Motor-Controller/tree/master/PWM_Generator/PWM-Controller)
* [Serial Paraller Interface](https://github.com/sudipbarua/Motor-Controller/tree/master/PWM_Generator/Serial-Parallel-Interface)
* [Signal Generator](https://github.com/sudipbarua/Motor-Controller/tree/master/PWM_Generator/Signal-Generator)
